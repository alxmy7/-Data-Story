    "As you age your risk of contracting heart disease also grows. The graph shows the percentage of the population that suffers from heart disease. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States of America. From the sandy beaches of California to the harbors of New York hundreds of people lose their lives to heart disease every year. The age difference doesn't increment by the same amount each time, this is due to a lack of data for people under the age of 25. Your risk of contracting heart disease only increases as you age. Originally I planned to look at how heart disease effects different genders, but this didn't work well. Looking at rates of heart disease while ignoring the age of the particpants would make the data misleading. I decided to look at age instead because it's a lot more relvant, also rates of heart disease hardly changed between different genders. Visualizing this data shows the direct correlation between age and heart disease, being able to see the slopes gradual rise only helps viewers understand this. There are issues with this visualazation though, age isn't the sole cause of heart disease. Many factors like smoking or obesity aren't taken into account. This visulization implies age is the main factor in contracting heart disease which is not the case. "

<!# My laptop broke down at the start of this semester so I haven't been able to bring a computer to class. Without a laptop, I couldn't receive any feedback from my classmates.
# Originally I had an issue with visualization due to trying to include how heart disease rates changed over the years. This caused a lot of problems. There is no flat heart disease rate displayed in the data, each figure represents an age group. If I wanted my visualization to focus on how heart disease rates have changed over time I'd have to select a specific age group. I realized it'd make a lot more sense if I just looked at how heart disease rates changed based on age. If I was to start this project over, I'd make multiple different visualizations. My current visualization is only for one year, the data covers several different years. If I included multiple different visualizations for multiple different years I could've shown how heart disease rates are decreasing yearly.
# I believe this visualization leaves out a lot of stories. Focusing entirely on age leaves out a lot of information. The main cause of heart disease is not age, but age does contribute to issues that cause heart disease. It's easier to be physically inactive when you're older, it's also more likely your blood pressure isn't perfect as you age. These two factors often cause heart disease, which means age isn't the main factor. Age plays a role in causing problems which can lead to heart disease. My visualization makes it look like age is the main factor which is not true. I believe if I looked at heart diseases comorbidity with other conditions I could create something that highlights the actual causes of heart disease.
# My favorite part of this project was learning about how misleading data can be. Creating a misleading graph using real information is honestly a little too easy. It made me think about how I engage with stats, I realized I needed to look past the surface level anytime a claim is made using data. I realized data can often be misleading if it's presented a certain way.  >
